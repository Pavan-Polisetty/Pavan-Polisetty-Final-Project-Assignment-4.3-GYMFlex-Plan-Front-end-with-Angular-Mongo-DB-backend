Installing all necessary packages, including express, bodyparser, cors, and mongoose packers, is the initial step. The newly constructed "HardrockGYM" backend database file is connected via a restful API. The clients' memberships in the gym, age, weightloss calories, gym experience, calorie target, Heavy Intensity Training (HIT) requirement, and workout goals are all included in this Mongo DB. The backend is the mongo database once it has been constructed. A server is constructed, and it connects to the HarrockGYM database in the background. We now use Angular to connect to the server and access the database on the front end. We create the connection to the server and then the database in the Anguar server file. Finally, we use Angular to send an HTTP request to the database using the "HardrockGYMapi" api. Through this api, the HTTP request makes a database query and accesses information on gym patrons' memberships.
